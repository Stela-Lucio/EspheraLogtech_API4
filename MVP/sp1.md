# 📌 MVP - Port Operations Analysis

## 🎯 Objective of MVP
- *What problem does it solve?*

The MVP of sprint 1 aims to present the key analyses and data extracted from the 2020 to 2024 dataset, in an initial form without extensive filtering. This is intended to provide the client with a preliminary overview of the material collected so far.

- *What hypothesis will be validated?*

The hypothesis that presenting the initial analyses and extracted data is sufficient to generate an initial understanding and guide the next steps of the project will be validated.

- *What value will be delivered to the end user?*

A clear and structured summary of the preliminary analyses will be delivered, enabling the user to validate the progress of the work and plan the next actions.
