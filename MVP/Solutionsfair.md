# 📌 MVP - Port Operations Analysis

## 🎯Objective of Final Stage
- *What was completed?*

In the final stage of the project, the team delivered the complete and functional version of the Port Operations Dashboard. This delivery consolidated all analyses developed throughout the project and marked the official closure of the solution.

- *What does it aim to solve?*

The aim was to provide a clear, robust, and interactive tool capable of supporting strategic understanding of port logistics, highlighting patterns, efficiency metrics, and operational bottlenecks.

- *What hypothesis was validated?*

That a fully structured dashboard, organized into segmented analytical views and supported by corrected datasets and refined modeling, offers users a practical way to identify which ports stand out, where inefficiencies occur, and how cargo behavior evolves over time.

- *What value was delivered to the user?*

The final dashboard provides four complete analytical perspectives:
1. General Analysis of exports

2. Product-Specific Analysis, focused on iron

3. Port Efficiency Analysis, including Top 10 efficiency ranking

4. Operational Stoppage Analysis, with main causes identified

Additionally, improvements were made to the efficiency code based on client feedback, strengthening the accuracy of the DEA-based evaluation.

## 📝 Solution Description
The final solution includes:

- Development and refinement of four interactive analytical views
- Corrections in the efficiency model code, ensuring proper calculation aligned with client expectations
- Consolidation of updated datasets for all visualizations
- Final adjustments to layout, filters, and navigation
- Evidence showing that one of the Top 3 most efficient ports is Ponta da Madeira, which also ranks as the port with the highest export volume today

Validation that these visualizations are essential to support decisions on what can or should be improved operationally
